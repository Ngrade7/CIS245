Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.
Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from: http://openweathermap.org/
Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
Use comments within the application, where appropriate, in order to document what the program is doing.
Use functions including a main function.
Allow the user to run the program multiple times.
Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isnâ€™t presented, notify the user.
Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful.
